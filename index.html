                            Create a compelling, thoughtful post and tap “submit”. Make it a good one because you're staking a bit of your reputation on it.

                            Your post goes through a curation process where the community votes on whether or not to promote it. When a post of yours is promoted, it means it fits the character of the community, and you earn reputation points as a reward. Right on!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the other hand, if your post gets demoted, you lose your staked reputation. It might be kind of a let down, but that's how we curate the very best scenes and anecdotes from around the world.
